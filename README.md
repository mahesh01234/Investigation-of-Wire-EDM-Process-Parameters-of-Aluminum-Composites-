â€¢	In this project, the stir-casting method is utilized to prepare aluminum composites with Graphene and Carbon nanotubes. Using a Wire EDM machine, cutting tests were conducted while varying parameters such as Current, Pulse on time, and Wire feed rate. By analyzing the output parameters of kerf width, cutting speed, and material removal rate, we will be able to determine the strongest composite with the minimum kerf width.
